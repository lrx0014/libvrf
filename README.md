# libvrf

## Verifiable Random Functions

A Verifiable Random Function (VRF) is a cryptographic public-key primitive that, from a secret key and a given input, produces a unique pseudorandom output, along with a proof that the output was correctly computed.
Only the secret key holder can generate the output–proof pair, but anyone with the corresponding public key can verify the proof.

`libvrf` is a C++20 implementation of several VRFs.
It comes with a CMake based build system, unit tests, and benchmarks.

### Build

To build `libvrf`, ensure [vcpkg](https://GitHub.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) is installed (and the environment variable `VCPKG_ROOT` is set).
Then run
```bash
cmake --preset <preset-name>
cmake --build --preset <preset-name>
cmake --install out/build/<preset-name> # optional; to install in custom destination, include --prefix <destination>
```
The list of available options for `<preset-name>` can be seen by running `cmake --list-presets`.
The presets will automatically build the test and benchmark suites.
After building, the executables `vrf_tests[.exe]` and `vrf_benchmarks[.exe]` are available in `out/build/<preset-name>/bin`.

If you do not want to use presets, you can specify `-DLIBVRF_BUILD_TESTS=ON` and `-DLIBVRF_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON` to build the test and the benchmark suites.

## Implemented VRFs

`libvrf` implements RSA-FDH VRF and elliptic curve VRF based on [RFC9381](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9381).
It also implements an RSA VRF variant based on RSA-PSS signatures with no nonce.

### Warning

The security models of VRFs are non-trivial.
For example, RSA-based VRFs are not secure unless the key generation process is trusted.
For more details and explanation of the security guarantees, see [RFC9381](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9381).

## Usage

`libvrf` exposes a simple API for creating VRF keypairs, producing proofs, verifying them, and (de)serializing keys and proofs.
These functionalities are illustrated in the examples below.

### 1) Choosing the VRF type and key generation

All supported VRF implementations are listed in [vrf/type.h](vrf/type.h).
They are described by the following enum values:

- `vrf::Type::RSA_FDH_VRF_RSA2048_SHA256`
- `vrf::Type::RSA_FDH_VRF_RSA3072_SHA256`
- `vrf::Type::RSA_FDH_VRF_RSA4096_SHA384`
- `vrf::Type::RSA_FDH_VRF_RSA4096_SHA512`
- `vrf::Type::RSA_PSS_NOSALT_VRF_RSA2048_SHA256`
- `vrf::Type::RSA_PSS_NOSALT_VRF_RSA3072_SHA256`
- `vrf::Type::RSA_PSS_NOSALT_VRF_RSA4096_SHA384`
- `vrf::Type::RSA_PSS_NOSALT_VRF_RSA4096_SHA512`
- `vrf::Type::EC_VRF_P256_SHA256_TAI`

The following code snippet creates an RSA-FDH VRF with a 2048-bit key and uses SHA-256 as a hash function.
The `vrf::VRF::Create` function creates a VRF secret key and stores it in memory.
Failure can be tested by checking that the output is not `nullptr` and the `is_initialized()` member function returns `true`.
```cpp
#include <memory>
#include <stdexcept>
#include "vrf/vrf.h"

vrf::Type type = vrf::Type::RSA_FDH_VRF_RSA2048_SHA256;
std::unique_ptr<vrf::SecretKey> sk = vrf::VRF::Create(type);
if (!sk || !sk->is_initialized()) {
    throw std::runtime_error("VRF secret key creation failed");
}
```

### 2) Accessing keys

Once a `vrf::SecretKey` instance has been successfully created, the public key can be retrieved as follows:
```cpp
std::unique_ptr<vrf::PublicKey> pk = sk->get_public_key();
if (!pk || !pk->is_initialized()) {
    throw std::runtime_error("VRF public key creation failed");
}
```

The secret key cannot be serialized, although we may add this capability in the future.
The public key can be serialized (to a DER-encoded SPKI struct) and deserialized as follows:
```cpp
// To serialize
std::vector<std::byte> der_spki = pk->to_bytes();
if (der_spki.empty()) {
    throw std::runtime_error("Failed to serialize public key");
}

// To deserialize, the caller is responsible for providing the correct type as input.
// If a type for which the deserialized key is not valid is provided, pk2->is_initialized()
// will return false.
std::unique_ptr<vrf::PublicKey> pk2 = vrf::VRF::public_key_from_bytes(type, der_spki);
if (!pk2 || !pk2->is_initialized()) {
    throw std::runtime_error("Deserialization failed");
}
```

### 3) Prove and verify

Given an input `data`, the secret key can produce a VRF proof.
The public key verifies the proof and returns whether the verification succeeded, and if so, the VRF "hash" value.
```cpp
std::vector<std::byte> data = /* your bytes */;

// The proof is sent to the verifier (who has the public key).
std::unique_ptr<vrf::Proof> proof = sk->get_vrf_proof(data);
if (!proof || !proof->is_initialized()) {
    throw std::runtime_error("Proof creation failed");
}

// Verify the proof with the public key.
std::pair<bool, std::vector<std::byte>> res = pk->verify_vrf_proof(data, proof);
if (!res.first) {
    throw std::runtime_error("Proof verification failed");
}

// The proof verified successfully and hash is a byte array that holds the VRF value.
// The VRF value can also be obtained directly from the proof object as follows.
// However, this does *not* verify the proof!
std::vector<std::byte> hash2 = res.second->get_vrf_value();
if (hash2.empty()) {
    throw std::runtime_error("Failed to extract VRF value");
}
```

The proof can be serialized and deserialized as follows:
```cpp
// To serialize
std::vector<std::byte> proof_bytes = proof->to_bytes();
if (proof_bytes.empty()) {
    throw std::runtime_error("Failed to serialize proof");
}

// To deserialize
std::unique_ptr<vrf::Proof> proof2 = vrf::VRF::proof_from_bytes(type, proof_bytes);
if (!proof2 || !proof2->is_initialized()) {
    throw std::runtime_error("Deserialization failed");
}
```

### 4) Other functions

All of the VRF objects above (`vrf::SecretKey`, `vrf::PublicKey`, `vrf::Proof`) store their `vrf::Type`.
This can retrieved using the member function `get_type()`.

Each of the functions taking as input `std::span` of bytes has a flexible set of overloads that accepts spans of other 1-byte types (e.g., `unsigned char`, see the `ByteLike` concept in [vrf/vrf_base.h](vrf/vrf_base.h)), as well as overloads that accept a `std::ranges::contiguous_range` of similar 1-byte types with some limitations (see the `ByteRange` concept in [vrf/vrf_base.h](vrf/vrf_base.h)).
This means that these functions can be called also by passing directly (by value or reference) `std::vector`, `std:array`, or other similar containers.

### 5) Logging

`libvrf` provides a simple logging API (see [vrf/log.h](vrf/log.h)), which can be adapted to work with almost any logging system.
By default, the library simply logs to `std::cout` and `std::cerr` using the logger specified in [vrf/stdout_log.cpp](vrf/stdout_log.cpp).
To create a custom logger, include [vrf/log.h](vrf/log.h) in your source file and create an instance of `std::shared_ptr<vrf::Logger>` using `vrf::Logger::Create`.
This function takes as input three arrays of operation handlers (wrapped in `std::function`) for (1) the actual logging operations, (2) manual flush events, and (3) closing the log.
Any of the handlers can be left as `nullptr`, in which case the function is simply not called.
For simple examples, see [vrf/stdout_log.cpp](vrf/stdout_log.cpp) and [tests/log_tests.cpp](tests/log_tests.cpp).

Once a `std::shared_ptr<vrf::Logger>` instance has been created, it can be used to log messages at different log levels (see `vrf::LogLevel` in [vrf/log.h](vrf/log.h)).
It can also be used to set a (minimum) log level, so that logs at any lower level will not be logged.
The default log level is `vrf::LogLevel::INFO`.
